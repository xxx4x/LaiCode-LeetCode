Partition Linked List(42)
Given a linked list and a target value T, partition it such that all nodes less than T
are listed before the nodes larger than or equal to target value T.
The original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions should be preserved.
Examples
- L = 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> null, T = 3, is partitioned to 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> null
  [[5,5,5,5,4],5]
  L = 2 -> 4 -> 3-> 1->5->null
  L = 2 -> 4 -> 1->3 ->5-> null
  L = 2->  1->4->3->5
